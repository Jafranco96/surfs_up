# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
To procure capital backing for a surf and ice cream shop busines located in the Hawaiian island of Oahu, investors have asked for a thorough analysis of the weather patterns of the island. Before investing their capital in the business, investors want to ensure that the shop would be able to prosper and grow within Oahu’s standard weather seasons. 

Using Python and SQLAlchemy, an analysis of the yearlong precipitation patterns of the island was delivered to the investors. While the results painted a positive picture in regards to viability of the shop, the investors have asked for additional analyses to further corroborate the initial findings. Their next ask is to analyze the temperature data for the months of June and December to ensure that the shop would be a sustainable year-round business. With these additional deliverables, the investors would have the necessary information to make their investing decision.

## Analysis Results 
Completing the examination of June and December’s temperature data, three key differences in the results can be identified.

•	The mean temperature in June was 75 degrees Fahrenheit while December had a mean temperature of 71 degrees Fahrenheit.

•	The minimum recorded temperature in June was 64 degrees Fahrenheit while the minimum recorded temperature in December was 56 degrees Fahrenheit.

•	The maximum recorded temperature in June was 85 degrees Fahrenheit while the maximum recorded temperature in December was 83 degrees Fahrenheit.

The full descriptive statics summaries of each month can be seen below:

## Analysis Results Summary
The two descriptive summaries show that there should be no expected extreme weather that could impact the viability of the shop. Both months recorded an average temperature of at least 70 degrees Fahrenheit, an ideal weather type for the shop’s purpose. Furthermore, even with the lowest recorded temperate of 56 degrees Fahrenheit, the shop should not find its operations impacted. 

To increase the investor’s confidence even more, additional queries could be performed on the monthly temperature data. One example would be to further divide the analysis by year, to determine if the mean temperatures were derived from predictable weather behavior or an oscillation between weather extremes. Another example would be also to group the analysis by days, to ensure that the shop would be able to operate any day of the week.

With the analyses already completed and the additional queries recommended, the investors should be confident in investing in the surf and ice cream shop busines.
